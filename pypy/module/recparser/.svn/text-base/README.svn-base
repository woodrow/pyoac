this is a 'standalone' version of the parser module
as of now it needs '.' to be in the PYTHONPATH so that eg
import ebnf # works

This should change once we figure out how to integrate properly with
pypy and add an option to switch between the two parsers


to enable the module in py.py change :
baseobjspace.py:89
pypy/interpreter/baseobjspace.py:89
setbuiltinmodule( "parser", "recparser" )
