This is mostly a copy of the pure Python compiler of Python
2.4.1.  Despite the name "stable" it is heavily buggy and only
suitable for tasks like superficial inspection of modules.
(It's still less buggy than Python 2.4.1's, sadly.)

It should be removed, but for now we keep it around so that
tests have something to compare against.
