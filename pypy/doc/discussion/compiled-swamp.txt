We've got huge swamp of compiled pypy-c's used for:

* benchmarks
* tests
* compliancy tests
* play1
* downloads
* ...

We've got build tool, which we don't use, etc. etc.

Idea is to formalize it more or less, so we'll have single script
to make all of this work, upload builds to the web page etc.
