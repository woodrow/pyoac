Things we would like to write papers about
==========================================

- object space architecture + reflective space
- stackless transformation
- composable coroutines
- jit:
  - overview paper
  - putting our jit into the context of classical partial evaluation
  - a jit technical paper too, probably

- sandboxing

Things about which writing a paper would be nice, which need more work first
============================================================================

- taint object space
- logic object space

- jit

  - with some more work: how to deal in a JIT backend with less-that-
      full-function compilation unit

  - work in progress (Anto?): our JIT on the JVM
  - (later) removing the overhead of features not used, e.g. thunk space or
      another special space
