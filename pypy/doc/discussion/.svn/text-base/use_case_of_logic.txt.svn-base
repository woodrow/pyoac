Use cases for a combination of Logic and Object Oriented programming approach
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Workflows
=========

Defining the next state by solving certain constraints. The more
general term might be State machines.

Business Logic
==============

We define Business Logic as expressing consistency (as an example) on
a set of objects in a business application.

For exeample checking the consistency of a calculation before
committing the changes.

The domain is quite rich in example of uses of Busines Logic.

Datamining
===========

An example is Genetic sequence matching.

Databases
=========

Validity contraints for the data can be expressed as constraints.

Constraints can be used to perform type inference when querying the
database.

Semantic web
=============

The use case is like the database case, except the ontology langauge
it self is born out of Descriptive Logic


User Interfaces
===============

We use rules to describe the layout and visibility constraints of
elements that are to be displayed on screen. The rule can also help
describing how an element is to be displayed depending on its state
(for instance, out of bound values can be displayed in a different
colour).

Configuration
==============

User configuration can use information infered from : the current
user, current plantform , version requirements, ...

The validity of the configuration can be checked with the constraints.


Scheduling and planning
========================

Timetables, process scheduling, task scheduling.

Use rules to determin when to execute tasks (only start batch, if load
is low, and previous batch is finished.

Load sharing.

Route optimisation. Planning the routes of a technitian based on tools
needed and such

An example is scheduling a confenre like Europython see:
